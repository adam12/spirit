# Spirit
_Giving life to a user's FreeBSD daemons_

Lets be honest, I never started out wanting to make a process manager... I just
wanted to deploy my code and run my applications.

But I don't want the calling of `sudo` to be part of my deployment strategy, and
none of the other process managers fit my requirements (maybe I missed one - there
are already so many).

## Previous incarnations

This is the 3rd and hopefully final incarnation of Spirit.

The first incarnation was written in Crystal, was incomplete, and can be found
[here](https://github.com/adam12/spirit).

The second incarnation was written in Nim, was mostly feature complete with a
somewhat smaller feature scope, and can be found [here](https://github.com/adam12/spirit.nim).

## Goals

- Light memory usage
- Dependency free
- Single binary
- Procfile configuration
- Run from crontab @reboot
- Non-forking processes only

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/adam12/spirit.go.

I love pull requests! If you fork this project and modify it, please ping me to see
if your changes can be incorporated back into this project.

That said, if your feature idea is nontrivial, you should probably open an issue to
[discuss it](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/)
before attempting a pull request.
